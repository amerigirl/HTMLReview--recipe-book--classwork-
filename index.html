          Mix or stir butter with peanut butter until smooth. Add brown sugar
          and granulated sugar and mix until creamy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Beat in vanilla, egg, baking soda, and salt. Mix in flour slowly until
          cookie dough forms. Stir in chocolate chips.
        </li>
        <li>
          Scoop 2 tablespoon sized cookie dough balls onto cookie sheets covered
          with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Chill 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F.</li>
        <li>Press cookie dough balls flat with the tines of a fork.</li>
        <li>
          Bake cookies for 8-12 minutes, or until slightly brown on the bottom
          and the top just loses the wet cookie dough look.
        </li>
        <li>
          Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days or freeze for up to
          one month.

      </table>
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Instructions:</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Mix the chopped broccoli and cheese together in a large bowl. Add the
          egg, spices, and mix everything together with your hands until it
          forms a sticky mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Shape the Balls. Now, shape the mixture into small ball-sized shapes
          with your hands. Make each ball approximately 1 inch in diameter, but
          not bigger than 1 and ½ inches. Or else the balls my flatten into a
          patty. Tip. Using your finger push a hole in each ball and add a small
          cube of solid cheese, such as Velveeta, cream cheese, Mozzarella
          cheese, or Goat cheese. Then close the hole and continue rolling the
          broccoli appetizer into a ball shape. Although it is optional, this
          will create the oozing cheese effect with an incredible cheese pull.
          Coat in Panko. Roll each ball in Panko breadcrumbs and ensure that it
          is fully coated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Freeze the balls on a parchment-lined baking tray for 30 minutes to an
          hour. While this step is optional, this will insure that the balls
          will not fall apart when air frying.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat your air fryer to 400F. Don’t skip this step. It’s important
          that the Broccoli cheddar poppers will start cooking immediately in a
          very hot air fryer. Place each ball onto your greased air fryer tray,
          leaving enough space for the air to circulate around each piece.
          Lightly spray each ball with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>
          Set your air fryer to 400°F and cook the broccoli cheddar bites for 5
          minutes on each side. This means flip each ball on the other side
          after 5 minutes. Tip: Use the help of two spatulas to gently flip
          them. Do not use tongs, as they may accidentally crush the balls.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once they are done, remove them from the air fryer (I use flat
          silicone spatula to gently lift each ball) and place them onto a
          plate.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <strong>Instructions:</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9x5 metal loaf pan; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mash the bananas; set aside.</li>
        <li>
          In a large bowl, use a hand mixer to cream together butter and sugars
          for 2 to 3 minutes, until well combined and fluffy (you can also use a
          stand mixer.)
        </li>
        <li>Add in the eggs, mashed banana and vanilla and mix well.</li>
        <li>
          Sift the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt into the wet
          ingredients, then fold in until just combined. Fold in 3/4 cup of the
          chocolate chips.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Sprinkle the remaining
          chocolate chips on top. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until the bread
          is set and a knife inserted into the center of the loaf comes out
          clean. Allow the bread to cool for at least 20 minutes before serving.
